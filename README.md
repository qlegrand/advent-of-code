## Day 1
Nothing to note in particular. As with all these puzzles, I take a "get things done" approach vs. efficiency

I had a facepalm moment with the first puzzle when I initially computed the sum of IDs of games that were not possible. I corrected it very inelegantly, but pretty fast though 

## Day 3
Probably could have done some optimisation and elimidate some boilerplate, but it gets stuff done!

## Day 4

For the first time also, I have been re-using a function accross the 2 puzzles
